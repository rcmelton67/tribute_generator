      <p>2012 - 2022</p>
      <p>Shared by Rodney and Tina, AR</p>

    <div class="mm-tribute-message">
      <p>Some dogs are companions.  </p>
<p>Some dogs are protectors.  </p>
<p>And once in a lifetime, if you are fortunate, you are given one who becomes part of your identity.</p>
<p><strong>Phoebe was that dog for us.</strong></p>
<p>Phoebe, our American Akita, came home as a puppy in 2012 — strong-boned, alert, already carrying the dignified presence Akitas are known for. She wore a bold black mask across her face, with a thick brown and white coat that made her look powerful long before she understood how much of a guardian she would become.</p>
<p>She was confident. Intelligent. Observant.  </p>
<p>But above all — she was <strong>loyal</strong>.</p>
<h2>A Loyal and Protective American Akita</h2>
<p>American Akitas are known for deep devotion to their family. Phoebe embodied that devotion fully.</p>
<p>She guarded our home in Alma with quiet authority. She didn’t bark at nothing. She evaluated. She watched. She positioned herself where she could see every entrance. If someone pulled into the driveway, she knew before we did.</p>
<p>She wasn’t everyone’s dog.  </p>
<p>She was our dog.</p>
<p>And she was Tina’s baby — a true mama’s girl. Her loyalty to Tina was absolute. Protective without hesitation. Gentle without being weak.</p>
<p>Phoebe slept inside, often at the foot of our bed — sometimes right between us — always close enough to know her people were safe.</p>
<p>That was her purpose.  </p>
<p>That was her pride.</p>
<h2>The Moment We’ll Never Forget</h2>
<p>Every single day when we returned home from work, Phoebe greeted us the same way.</p>
<p>She would whine.</p>
<p>Not bark.  </p>
<p>Not howl.</p>
<p>She would whine in overwhelming happiness — a high, trembling sound of pure excitement after being alone for hours. Her entire body would move with emotion. She couldn’t contain it.</p>
<p>She wasn’t upset.  </p>
<p>She was relieved.</p>
<p>Her people were home.</p>
<p>That sound is something we will carry with us forever.</p>
<h2>Alma Park, the Dog Park &amp; Braum’s Frozen Yogurt</h2>
<p>Phoebe loved her routines.</p>
<p>Walks at Alma Park weren’t casual strolls — they were serious investigative missions. Her nose stayed low, tracking scent trails of squirrels, rabbits, and anything that had passed through before her. American Akitas are working dogs at heart, and Phoebe never ignored that instinct.</p>
<p>At the dog park, she carried herself with confidence. Calm. Measured. Watchful.</p>
<p>And then there was her softer side.</p>
<p>If we stopped at Braum’s for frozen yogurt, she knew exactly what was happening. Her eyes focused. Her posture straightened. She waited patiently, but hopeful. That frozen yogurt might have been her favorite indulgence.</p>
<h2>The Creek</h2>
<p>One of the most peaceful memories we have is Phoebe in a creek.</p>
<p>She didn’t charge into the water.</p>
<p>She stepped carefully. Then waded. Then waddled slowly through the shallows, nose working constantly, studying every scent carried downstream.</p>
<p>In those moments she looked both powerful and gentle at the same time.</p>
<p>Strong, but grounded.  </p>
<p>Protective, but peaceful.</p>
<h2>The Day She Guarded the House Alone</h2>
<p>Phoebe took her job seriously.</p>
<p>One afternoon while we were at work, a stray cat entered our home through her doggie door. When we returned, we heard barking behind a closed bedroom door.</p>
<p>Phoebe had chased the cat into the room. In the commotion, the door had shut, trapping them both inside. The cat had climbed onto a closet shelf. Phoebe stood below, barking, determined, guarding her territory.</p>
<p>She had done exactly what she believed she was meant to do.</p>
<p>She protected her home.  </p>
<p>She protected us — even when we weren’t there.</p>
<p>That was Phoebe.</p>
<h2>Losing Our Akita Changed Us</h2>
<p>We are the owners of Melton Memorials, and we have crafted many pet memorial stones for families over the years.</p>
<p>But when Phoebe passed in 2022, memorial work became deeply personal in a new way.</p>
<p>Designing a dog memorial stone for your own American Akita changes your understanding. You begin to see every name differently. You feel every date carved in stone more deeply.</p>
<p>You understand why families want permanence.  </p>
<p>Why engraving must be deep.  </p>
<p>Why outdoor durability matters.  </p>
<p>Why memorial stones must endure.</p>
<p>Because the love does.</p>
<p>Phoebe shaped not only our lives — but how we approach every memorial we create.</p>
<h2>An American Akita’s Legacy</h2>
<p>Phoebe lived exactly as an American Akita should:</p>
<p>Protective.  </p>
<p>Loyal.  </p>
<p>Selective in affection.  </p>
<p>Fiercely devoted to her people.</p>
<p>She loved Tina completely.  </p>
<p>She loved her walks.  </p>
<p>She loved the creek.  </p>
<p>She loved tracking scents.  </p>
<p>She loved frozen yogurt.  </p>
<p>She loved greeting us with overwhelming joy when we came home.</p>
<p>She gave us ten years of strength, presence, and devotion.</p>
<h2>Phoebe  </h2>
<p>American Akita  </p>
<p>2012–2022  </p>
<p><strong>Forever our protector.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Forever Tina’s girl.</strong>  </p>
<p><strong>Forever family.</strong></p>
